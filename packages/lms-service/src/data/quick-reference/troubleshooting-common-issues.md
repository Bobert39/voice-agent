4. **Document the attempt**
   - Note which methods were tried
   - Reason for verification difficulty
   - Resolution or next steps

### When to Escalate

- System shows security alerts
- You're unsure about HIPAA compliance

   - Delegate MEDIUM/LOW if possible

2. **Quick assessment**
   - Scan each escalation for complexity
   - Identify which can be resolved quickly
   - Check for any that can be delegated

3. **Communication**
   - Update patients on wait times
   - "I have you in our priority queue, estimated wait is X minutes"
   - Thank them for patience

4. **Resource management**
   - Request backup staff if available
   - Use supervisor escalation for complex cases
   - Focus on clearing quick wins first

### Delegation Guidelines
