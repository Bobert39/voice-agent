# Test Priorities Matrix

## Overview
This matrix defines test priority levels (P0-P3) to ensure critical functionality is tested first and resources are allocated effectively.

## Priority Definitions

### P0 - Critical (Must Test)
**Definition**: Revenue-critical, security, compliance, or patient safety features

**Characteristics**:
- Blocks release if failing
- Run on every commit
- Zero tolerance for failures
- Immediate fix required
- Maximum test coverage (>95%)

**Response Time**: Fix within 2 hours

**Examples**:
- HIPAA compliance validations
- Patient data security
- Payment processing
- Emergency call handling
- PHI encryption
- Authentication/authorization
- Data integrity checks

### P1 - High (Core Functionality)
**Definition**: Core user journeys and frequently used features

**Characteristics**:
- Major user impact if broken
- Run multiple times daily
- High priority for fixes
- Comprehensive test coverage (>85%)
- Key business workflows

**Response Time**: Fix within 24 hours

**Examples**:
- Appointment booking flow
- Patient verification process
- Voice recognition accuracy
- Appointment availability lookup
- Multi-turn conversation handling
- Staff escalation workflow
- Confirmation delivery

### P2 - Medium (Secondary Features)
**Definition**: Secondary features, admin functions, and nice-to-have functionality

**Characteristics**:
- Moderate user impact
- Run daily in CI/CD
- Scheduled fix in sprint
- Good test coverage (>70%)
- Supporting workflows

**Response Time**: Fix within 1 sprint

**Examples**:
- Practice information queries
- Appointment rescheduling
- Report generation
- Non-critical integrations
- Performance optimizations
- UI enhancements
- Analytics tracking

### P3 - Low (Edge Cases)
**Definition**: Rarely used features, edge cases, and cosmetic issues

**Characteristics**:
- Minimal user impact
- Run weekly or on-demand
- Fix as time permits
- Basic test coverage (>50%)
- Non-blocking issues

**Response Time**: Fix in backlog

**Examples**:
- Timezone edge cases
- Rare error scenarios
- Cosmetic UI issues
- Legacy feature support
- Optional integrations
- Debug utilities
- Documentation tests

## Priority Assignment Criteria

### Business Impact Matrix

| Factor | P0 | P1 | P2 | P3 |
|--------|----|----|----|----|
| Revenue Impact | Direct loss | Indirect impact | Minor impact | No impact |
| User Count | All users | >50% users | 10-50% users | <10% users |
| Compliance | Required | Recommended | Nice to have | Optional |
| Security | Critical vulnerability | High risk | Medium risk | Low risk |
| Frequency | Every interaction | Daily use | Weekly use | Rare use |
| Recovery | No workaround | Difficult workaround | Easy workaround | Not needed |

### Technical Risk Matrix

| Risk Factor | P0 | P1 | P2 | P3 |
|-------------|----|----|----|----|
| Data Loss | Permanent | Temporary | Recoverable | None |
| System Stability | Crash/Outage | Major degradation | Minor degradation | No impact |
| Integration | Core systems | Important systems | Optional systems | None |
| Performance | >10x degradation | 2-10x degradation | <2x degradation | No impact |

## Voice Agent Specific Priorities

### P0 Examples
- Patient identity verification failure
- HIPAA compliance violations
- Voice call connection failures
- Emergency escalation failures
- PHI data exposure
- Authentication bypasses
- Payment data security

### P1 Examples
- Appointment booking failures
- Voice recognition <80% accuracy
- Conversation context loss
- Confirmation delivery failures
- Multi-turn conversation breaks
- Staff notification failures
- Availability lookup errors

### P2 Examples
- Slow response times (>5s)
- Minor UI inconsistencies
- Non-critical API errors
- Report formatting issues
- Analytics tracking gaps
- Performance degradation
- Feature toggle failures

### P3 Examples
- Logging verbosity issues
- Debug mode problems
- Documentation mismatches
- Code style violations
- Deprecated API usage
- Minor memory leaks
- Accessibility warnings

## Test Execution Strategy

### Continuous Integration
- **P0**: Every commit, all branches
- **P1**: Every commit to main/develop
- **P2**: Daily scheduled runs
- **P3**: Weekly scheduled runs

### Release Testing
- **P0**: 100% coverage required
- **P1**: 100% coverage required
- **P2**: Risk-based selection
- **P3**: Smoke tests only

### Production Monitoring
- **P0**: Real-time alerts, 24/7 monitoring
- **P1**: Real-time alerts, business hours
- **P2**: Daily reports
- **P3**: Weekly reports

## Priority Escalation

Tests can be escalated based on:
1. **Frequency**: P3→P2 if issue occurs >10x/day
2. **Impact**: P2→P1 if affecting >50% users
3. **Compliance**: Any→P0 if regulatory requirement
4. **Security**: Any→P0 if security vulnerability
5. **Revenue**: P1→P0 if direct revenue impact

## Resource Allocation

### Testing Effort Distribution
- **P0**: 40% of testing resources
- **P1**: 35% of testing resources
- **P2**: 20% of testing resources
- **P3**: 5% of testing resources

### Automation Priority
1. Automate all P0 tests first
2. Automate P1 happy paths
3. Automate P2 based on ROI
4. P3 manual testing acceptable

## Reporting and Metrics

### Quality Gates
- **P0**: 100% pass rate required
- **P1**: >98% pass rate required
- **P2**: >95% pass rate required
- **P3**: >90% pass rate required

### SLA Compliance
Track and report:
- P0 fix time <2 hours
- P1 fix time <24 hours
- P2 fix time <1 sprint
- P3 backlog management
