## Phase 1.3.2: Multi-Factor Authentication Workflow üîê

### Patient Verification Process Flow

#### Step 1: Initial Contact and Consent
**Trigger:** Patient calls Voice AI system
**Process:**
1. AI provides HIPAA notice and requests consent for PHI processing
2. Patient verbally confirms consent to proceed
3. System logs consent timestamp and call identifier
4. Patient demographic verification begins

**Script Example:**
> \"Thank you for calling Capitol Eye Care. To protect your privacy under HIPAA, please know that this conversation may be recorded for quality and compliance purposes. To assist you with your protected health information, I'll need to verify your identity. Do you consent to this verification process?\"

**Security Controls:**
- All consent responses logged with timestamp
- Call recording consent included in HIPAA authorization
- Clear explanation of PHI usage and patient rights

#### Step 2: Identity Verification Collection
**Required Information:**
1. **Full Legal Name:** First name and last name as registered
2. **Date of Birth:** Month, day, and year verification
3. **Phone Number:** Primary phone number associated with patient record

**Collection Process:**
```
AI: "Please provide your full legal name as it appears in our records."
Patient: [Provides name]
AI: "Thank you. Now, please provide your date of birth."
Patient: [Provides DOB]
AI: "Finally, please confirm the phone number we have on file for you."
Patient: [Provides phone]
```

**Data Validation:**
- Real-time validation against encrypted OpenEMR database
- Fuzzy matching for common name variations
- Date format standardization and validation
- Phone number normalization and verification

#### Step 3: Verification Processing
**Technical Implementation:**
1. **Data Hashing:** Patient information hashed using SHA-256 before database lookup
2. **Secure Comparison:** Hashed values compared against stored hashes
3. **Confidence Scoring:** Multi-factor confidence algorithm determines match probability
4. **Result Processing:** Success/failure determination with detailed logging

**Verification Criteria:**
- **Exact Match Required:** All three factors must match exactly
- **Confidence Threshold:** 100% match required for successful verification
- **Attempt Tracking:** Maximum 3 attempts allowed within 15-minute session
- **Timeout Protection:** 30-second timeout per verification attempt

#### Step 4: Verification Outcome Processing

**Successful Verification:**
1. Generate secure session token (JWT with 15-minute expiration)
2. Create encrypted session in Redis with patient context
3. Log successful verification with audit trail
4. Proceed to authorized conversation flow
5. Update patient's last access timestamp

**Failed Verification:**
1. Log failed attempt with reason code (no PHI in logs)
2. Increment attempt counter for session
3. Provide generic failure message to patient
4. Offer retry or escalation to human staff
5. Automatic escalation after 3 failed attempts

**Example Responses:**
- **Success:** \"Thank you, your identity has been verified. How can I assist you today?\"
- **Failure:** \"I'm unable to verify that information. Please try again, or I can connect you with our staff for assistance.\"
