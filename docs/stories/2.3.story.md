### Technical Implementation Strategy
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **PostgreSQL 15.4**: Primary storage for practice information with relational data integrity
- **Redis 7.2**: Caching layer for frequently requested information (hours, location, policies)
- **GPT-4 API**: Dynamic response generation with practice-specific context and elderly-friendly patterns
- **Node.js/TypeScript**: Service implementation with Express.js REST endpoints

### Redis Caching Strategy Details
**Cache Key Structure**:
- `practice:hours:{date}` - Daily business hours (TTL: 24 hours)
- `practice:location:info` - Location and contact information (TTL: 7 days)
- `practice:insurance:accepted` - Insurance plan list (TTL: 24 hours)
- `practice:policies:general` - Practice policies and procedures (TTL: 7 days)
- `practice:preparation:{appointment_type}` - Preparation instructions (TTL: 24 hours)

**Cache Invalidation Strategy**:
- **Manual Updates**: Immediate cache invalidation when staff updates practice information
- **Scheduled Refresh**: Daily refresh of hours and insurance information at 6 AM
- **Event-Driven**: OpenEMR integration triggers cache updates for schedule changes
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Database queries when cache miss with automatic cache population

**Cache Performance Targets**:
- **Hit Rate**: >95% for frequently requested information (hours, location, policies)
- **Response Time**: <50ms for cache hits, <200ms for cache misses with DB query
- **Cache Size**: <100MB total with LRU eviction for unused preparation instructions
- **Refresh Strategy**: Background refresh 30 minutes before TTL expiration

### Elderly-Friendly Design Requirements
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md]
- Speech synthesis optimized for hearing aid compatibility and clarity
- Slower information delivery pace with natural pauses for comprehension
- Clear verbal structuring with "First," "Second," etc. for complex information
- Repetition options without condescending language or tone

- **Location Information**: Address, parking instructions, accessibility features, public transportation
- **Insurance Information**: Accepted plans, verification requirements, payment options
- **Appointment Preparation**: Pre-visit instructions, what to bring, arrival time recommendations
- **Practice Policies**: Cancellation policy, late arrival policy, patient rights and responsibilities

### HIPAA Compliance for Practice Information
[Source: architecture/security.md]
- Practice information is generally non-PHI but audit logging still required
- Patient-specific preparation instructions based on appointment type may contain PHI
- Conversation logs must be encrypted and retained according to healthcare standards
- No personally identifiable information in practice information responses unless verified

### Performance Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Response generation time <500ms for immediate practice information
- Redis cache hit rate >95% for frequently requested information (hours, location)
- Database query optimization for complex schedule calculations
- Text-to-speech generation optimized for clarity over speed

### Integration Points
[Source: architecture/components.md]
