[Source: Epic 2 Story Sequence]
- **Story 2.1**: Patient verification service provides authenticated context for personalized responses
- **Story 2.2**: Natural language understanding system provides intent recognition for practice inquiries
- Integration points established for seamless information delivery based on verified patient context

### Practice Information Architecture
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]
- **Practice Information Service** as dedicated microservice for configurability and maintainability
- **PostgreSQL database** for structured practice information storage with HIPAA compliance
- **Redis caching** for frequently accessed information to reduce response latency
- **Integration with OpenEMR** for real-time schedule and availability information

### Technical Implementation Strategy
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **PostgreSQL 15.4**: Primary storage for practice information with relational data integrity
- **Redis 7.2**: Caching layer for frequently requested information (hours, location, policies)
- **GPT-4 API**: Dynamic response generation with practice-specific context and elderly-friendly patterns
- **Node.js/TypeScript**: Service implementation with Express.js REST endpoints

### Redis Caching Strategy Details
**Cache Key Structure**:
- `practice:hours:{date}` - Daily business hours (TTL: 24 hours)
- `practice:location:info` - Location and contact information (TTL: 7 days)
- `practice:insurance:accepted` - Insurance plan list (TTL: 24 hours)
- `practice:policies:general` - Practice policies and procedures (TTL: 7 days)
- `practice:preparation:{appointment_type}` - Preparation instructions (TTL: 24 hours)

**Cache Invalidation Strategy**:
- **Manual Updates**: Immediate cache invalidation when staff updates practice information
- **Scheduled Refresh**: Daily refresh of hours and insurance information at 6 AM
- **Event-Driven**: OpenEMR integration triggers cache updates for schedule changes
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Database queries when cache miss with automatic cache population

**Cache Performance Targets**:
- **Hit Rate**: >95% for frequently requested information (hours, location, policies)
- **Response Time**: <50ms for cache hits, <200ms for cache misses with DB query
- **Cache Size**: <100MB total with LRU eviction for unused preparation instructions
- **Refresh Strategy**: Background refresh 30 minutes before TTL expiration

### Elderly-Friendly Design Requirements
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md]
- Speech synthesis optimized for hearing aid compatibility and clarity
- Slower information delivery pace with natural pauses for comprehension
- Clear verbal structuring with "First," "Second," etc. for complex information
- Repetition options without condescending language or tone
- Simple confirmation mechanisms appropriate for phone interaction

### Practice Information Categories
[Source: architecture/components.md]
- **Business Hours**: Regular hours, holiday schedules, emergency contact information
- **Location Information**: Address, parking instructions, accessibility features, public transportation
- **Insurance Information**: Accepted plans, verification requirements, payment options
- **Appointment Preparation**: Pre-visit instructions, what to bring, arrival time recommendations
- **Practice Policies**: Cancellation policy, late arrival policy, patient rights and responsibilities

### HIPAA Compliance for Practice Information
[Source: architecture/security.md]
- Practice information is generally non-PHI but audit logging still required
- Patient-specific preparation instructions based on appointment type may contain PHI
- Conversation logs must be encrypted and retained according to healthcare standards
- No personally identifiable information in practice information responses unless verified

### Performance Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Response generation time <500ms for immediate practice information
- Redis cache hit rate >95% for frequently requested information (hours, location)
- Database query optimization for complex schedule calculations
- Text-to-speech generation optimized for clarity over speed

### Integration Points
[Source: architecture/components.md]
- **Patient Verification Service**: Provides authenticated patient context for personalized responses
- **Natural Language Understanding Service**: Supplies intent recognition and query parsing
- **Voice Processing Service**: Handles speech synthesis with elderly-friendly optimization
- **Audit Service**: Logs practice information requests for compliance and improvement analysis
- **OpenEMR Integration**: Real-time practice schedule and provider availability information

### Testing Strategy for Practice Information
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

- **Integration Tests**: Multi-service information delivery with realistic patient scenarios
- **Accessibility Tests**: Speech synthesis clarity and comprehension for elderly patients
- **Data Accuracy Tests**: Practice information consistency and real-time schedule accuracy
- **Performance Tests**: Response time optimization under concurrent information requests

### Response Pattern Examples
Based on elderly-friendly communication requirements:
- **Business Hours**: "We're currently open until 5 PM today. Tomorrow, Wednesday, we're open from 8 AM to 6 PM. Would you like me to repeat those hours?"
- **Location**: "Our office is located at 123 Main Street in downtown Springfield. That's 1-2-3 Main Street. We have free parking available in our lot behind the building."
- **Preparation**: "For your eye exam with dilation, please bring your current glasses and a list of all medications. You'll also need someone to drive you home. Should I repeat any of these instructions?"

### File Structure

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-14

### Reviewed By: BMad Master (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Story 2.3 shows substantial implementation progress in Archon MCP system. Core infrastructure components are completed:
- ✅ Practice-info-service microservice package structure established
- ✅ PostgreSQL database schema implemented for practice information storage  
- ✅ Redis caching layer implemented with TTL management
- 🔄 Dynamic response generation system in progress (currently "doing" status)

However, significant gaps exist between story requirements and current implementation scope.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Following monorepo TypeScript patterns from Story 1.1
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Microservice architecture maintained
- **Testing Strategy**: ✗ Critical gap - comprehensive testing missing
- **All ACs Met**: ✗ Missing elderly-specific testing and integration dependencies

### Critical Gaps Identified

**HIGH PRIORITY:**
1. **Story 2.2 Dependency**: Practice information system requires NLU integration (currently "todo" in Archon)
2. **Elderly Accessibility Testing**: Missing measurable outcomes testing (hearing aid compatibility >90%, retention >85%)
3. **Integration Testing**: Multi-service coordination tests not implemented
4. **Speech Synthesis Optimization**: 150-170 WPM with proper pauses not validated

**MEDIUM PRIORITY:**
1. **Conversation Context Integration**: Story 2.4 dependency needs completion
2. **Holiday Schedule Management**: Advanced notice capabilities need implementation
3. **Performance Testing**: Concurrent load testing (100+ calls) not implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Created Archon tasks for elderly-specific accessibility testing
- [x] Created integration task for Story 2.2 NLU system dependency  
- [x] Elevated Story 2.2 priority to task_order 5 (blocking dependency)
- [ ] Complete dynamic response generation (currently in progress)
- [ ] Implement comprehensive unit tests (85% coverage target)
- [ ] Validate speech synthesis elderly-friendly optimization
- [ ] Complete integration testing with realistic patient scenarios

### Security Review

✓ HIPAA compliance maintained through:
- Practice information stored in encrypted PostgreSQL
- Redis session encryption for patient context
- Audit logging for compliance tracking
- No PHI exposure in general practice information responses

### Performance Considerations

✓ Performance targets appropriate:
- Redis cache hit rate >95% target reasonable
- <500ms response time target achievable with current architecture
- Database optimization needed for complex schedule calculations

### Files Modified During Review

None - analysis performed against Archon MCP task tracking system

### Gate Status

Gate: **CONCERNS** → qa.qaLocation/gates/2.3-practice-information-response.yml
Risk profile: High due to missing elderly accessibility validation
NFR assessment: Performance and security frameworks adequate, testing gaps critical

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items above**

**CRITICAL PATH:** Story 2.2 (NLU) must be completed before Story 2.3 can be considered "Done"
