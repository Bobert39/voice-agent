## Dev Notes

### NLU Architecture Design
[Source: architecture/components.md]
- **NLU Service** as dedicated microservice for scalability and maintainability
- **GPT-4 API** for advanced intent recognition and entity extraction
- **Redis** for conversation context and session management
- **PostgreSQL** for intent training data and analytics storage

### Intent Categories for Optometry Practice
[Source: PRD and domain analysis]
- **Appointment**: Scheduling, rescheduling, cancellation, availability queries
- **Practice Information**: Hours, location, parking, policies, insurance acceptance
- **Medical**: Prescription refills, test results, post-procedure care
- **Financial**: Insurance coverage, payment options, billing questions
- **Emergency**: Urgent care needs, after-hours support, escalation triggers

### Entity Types for Healthcare Domain
[Source: healthcare domain requirements]
- **Temporal**: Dates, times, durations, recurring patterns
- **Medical**: Conditions, symptoms, medications, procedures
- **Provider**: Doctor names, staff references, departments
- **Insurance**: Carrier names, plan types, coverage queries
- **Location**: Office locations, directions, nearby landmarks

### Elderly-Specific Considerations
[Source: PRD elderly patient requirements]
- **Speech Patterns**: Slower pace, word-finding pauses, repetition
- **Medical Terminology**: Preference for lay terms over medical jargon
- **Cognitive Load**: Simpler sentence structures, one topic at a time
- **Patience Factors**: No rush indicators, supportive confirmations
- **Accessibility**: Clear enunciation tolerance, hearing aid compatibility

### Integration Architecture
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]
- **Event-Driven**: Publish intent recognition events for service coordination
- **API Gateway**: Centralized NLU endpoint for all voice interactions
- **Service Mesh**: Direct service-to-service communication for low latency
- **Circuit Breakers**: Fallback to rule-based NLU if GPT-4 unavailable

### Performance Requirements
[Source: architecture/nfr.md]
- **Intent Recognition**: <200ms for 95% of queries
- **Entity Extraction**: <100ms additional processing time
- **Context Retrieval**: <50ms from Redis cache
- **Total NLU Time**: <500ms end-to-end for voice response

### Testing Strategy
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Intent Accuracy**: 90% F1 score on healthcare intent test set
- **Entity Precision**: 85% extraction accuracy for critical entities
- **Elderly Speech**: 80% success rate with impaired speech patterns
- **Load Testing**: 100 concurrent NLU requests without degradation

### Security and Compliance
[Source: architecture/security.md]
- **PHI Protection**: No storage of raw utterances with patient data
- **Audit Logging**: Intent recognition results for compliance tracking
- **Encryption**: TLS for all API communications
- **Access Control**: Service-to-service authentication required

### Configuration Management
- **Intent Thresholds**: Configurable per intent category
- **Entity Patterns**: Regex and ML patterns in configuration
- **Escalation Rules**: Business rules for human handoff
- **Feature Flags**: Progressive rollout of NLU improvements
