2. Implement appointment type management with custom scheduling rules and time allocations
3. Design AI conversation tuning tools for adjusting response patterns and improving patient interactions
4. Create system backup and recovery procedures with regular testing protocols
5. Implement update management system for deploying improvements and security patches
6. Test configuration changes and maintenance procedures with practice workflow validation

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
From Story 4.4 completion notes: Learning Management System (LMS) was successfully implemented with comprehensive staff training modules, interactive scenarios, and feedback collection. The configuration system should integrate with the LMS for staff training on new features and configuration changes.

### Technology Stack Context
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Primary Language**: TypeScript 5.3.3 with Node.js 20.11.0 LTS
- **Framework**: Express.js 4.18.2 for HTTP services
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15.4 for configuration storage
- **Cache**: Redis 7.2 for configuration caching
- **Infrastructure**: AWS Lambda, API Gateway, S3 for backups
- **Testing**: Jest 29.7.0 for unit tests, Playwright 1.40.1 for E2E
- **Validation**: Zod 3.22.4 for schema validation
- **Security**: AWS KMS for encryption, Helmet 7.1.0 for security headers

### Service Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/components.md]
This story creates a new **Configuration Management Service** that will integrate with:
- **Admin Dashboard Service**: Extends existing React dashboard with configuration interfaces
- **Audit Logging Service**: All configuration changes must be logged for HIPAA compliance
- **Voice Processing Service**: AI conversation tuning affects voice response generation
- **Appointment Scheduling Service**: Appointment type changes affect scheduling logic
- **OpenEMR Integration Service**: Practice information affects EMR synchronization

### File Structure and Locations
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
New service will follow monorepo pattern under packages/:
- `packages/configuration-service/` - Main configuration management service
- `packages/configuration-service/src/routes/` - API endpoints
- `packages/configuration-service/src/services/` - Business logic
- `packages/configuration-service/src/models/` - Data models and validation
- `packages/configuration-service/src/__tests__/` - Test files
- Extensions to existing `packages/admin-dashboard/` for UI components

### Database Schema Requirements
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
Configuration data will be stored in PostgreSQL with:
- Versioned configuration tables for audit trail
- JSON columns for flexible configuration storage
- Foreign key relationships to existing practice data
- Encrypted fields for sensitive configuration data

### Security and Compliance
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md, architecture/security.md]
- All configuration changes must be audit logged for HIPAA compliance
- Configuration data containing PHI must be encrypted with AWS KMS
- Role-based access control for configuration management
- Security validation for all configuration inputs
- Backup encryption and secure retention policies

### API Integration Points
Configuration service will provide REST endpoints:
- `GET/POST /config/practice` - Practice information management
- `GET/POST /config/appointments/types` - Appointment type configuration
- `GET/POST /config/ai/personality` - AI conversation tuning
- `GET/POST /config/backup/schedule` - Backup configuration
- `GET/POST /config/updates/policies` - Update management settings

### Existing Services Integration
- Extend Admin Dashboard Service with new configuration UI components
- Integration with Voice Processing Service for AI tuning deployment
- Connection to Appointment Scheduling Service for type management
- Integration with Audit Logging Service for all configuration changes

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Unit Tests**: 85% coverage requirement using Jest 29.7.0
- **Integration Tests**: Testcontainers for PostgreSQL and Redis integration
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright 1.40.1 for configuration workflow validation
- **HIPAA Compliance**: All tests must validate data protection and audit logging

### Test File Locations
- Unit tests: `packages/configuration-service/src/__tests__/`
- Integration tests: `packages/configuration-service/src/__tests__/integration/`
- E2E tests: `packages/admin-dashboard/src/__tests__/e2e/configuration/`

### Specific Testing Requirements
- Configuration validation with invalid data scenarios
- Backup and recovery procedure testing
- Role-based access control validation
- Configuration change audit trail verification
- Performance testing for large configuration datasets
- Security testing for configuration data encryption
