### Conversation Flow Requirements
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md]
- Natural conversation patterns appropriate for elderly demographic
- Clear verbal cues for topic transitions and conversation progression
- Polite timeout handling that doesn't feel abrupt or rude
- Professional conversation closing with helpful next steps

### HIPAA Compliance for Conversations
[Source: architecture/security.md]
- Conversation content must be encrypted in Redis storage
- Audit logs for multi-turn conversations required for compliance
- Session timeout enforced to limit PHI exposure duration
- Conversation memory purged completely after session expiration

### Performance Considerations
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Redis session lookups must be <50ms to avoid conversation lag
- GPT-4 API calls optimized for conversation context without excessive token usage
- Conversation state kept minimal to reduce memory footprint
- Session cleanup processes to prevent Redis memory bloat

### Integration Points
[Source: architecture/components.md]
- **Patient Verification Service**: Provides authenticated patient context
- **Practice Information Service**: Supplies content for conversational responses
- **Voice Processing Service**: Handles speech-to-text and text-to-speech coordination
- **Audit Service**: Logs conversation patterns for HIPAA compliance and improvement analysis

### Testing Strategy for Conversations
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Unit Tests**: Conversation state management, memory references, timeout handling
- **Integration Tests**: Multi-service conversation flows with realistic scenarios
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete patient conversation journeys including escalation paths
- **Performance Tests**: Session storage performance under concurrent conversation load
- **User Acceptance Tests**: Elderly-friendly conversation flow validation

### Conversation Patterns for Elderly Patients
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md]
- Slower speech recognition processing with longer pause tolerance
- Clear verbal confirmation of topic changes and conversation progression
- Frequent summary statements to ensure understanding and engagement
- Patient-friendly language avoiding medical jargon in multi-turn exchanges
- Graceful handling of repetitive questions or confusion

### File Structure
Based on monorepo structure from Story 1.1:
- `/packages/voice-ai-service/src/conversation/` - Main conversation management logic
- `/packages/voice-ai-service/src/conversation/session.ts` - Session state management
- `/packages/voice-ai-service/src/conversation/memory.ts` - Conversation memory and references
- `/packages/voice-ai-service/src/conversation/flow.ts` - Conversation flow state machine
- `/packages/shared-utils/src/redis/` - Redis conversation storage utilities

### Error Handling Scenarios
[Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md]
- **Redis Connection Failure**: Graceful degradation with in-memory session state
- **GPT-4 API Timeout**: Fallback to template-based responses with conversation continuation
- **Session Corruption**: Recovery with polite conversation restart request
- **Memory Reference Errors**: Fallback responses without breaking conversation flow
