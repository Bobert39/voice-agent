# Story 4.3: Performance Monitoring and Alerting

**Epic**: Epic 4 - Production Operations & Staff Integration
**Story Points**: 13
**Priority**: Critical - System Reliability
**Risk Level**: High - Production Stability
**Status**: Done
## Story

**As a** system administrator,  
**I want** proactive monitoring of system performance and availability,  
**so that** issues are detected and resolved before they impact patient experience.

## Business Context

Capitol Eye Care's AI voice agent must maintain 99.9% availability during business hours to ensure patients can always reach the practice. Proactive monitoring and alerting enable the technical team to identify and resolve issues before patients experience service disruptions. This system serves as the early warning mechanism that protects the practice's reputation and ensures consistent patient care delivery.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ Implement comprehensive system monitoring including response times, error rates, and service availability
2. ✅ Create automated alerting for system failures, performance degradation, and capacity thresholds
3. ✅ Design performance analytics dashboard showing key metrics and trends over time
4. ✅ Implement health checks for all external dependencies (OpenEMR, Twilio, voice AI services)
5. ✅ Create automated failover procedures for critical system components
6. ✅ Test monitoring and alerting systems with simulated failure scenarios and recovery procedures

        from: process.env.TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER,
        url: `${process.env.API_URL}/voice/test`
      });
      
      // 2. Verify call connected
      await waitForCallStatus(call.sid, 'in-progress');
      
      // 3. Send test DTMF tones
      await sendDTMF(call.sid, '1234#');
      
      // 4. Verify response
      const transcript = await getCallTranscript(call.sid);
      assert(transcript.includes('verified'));
      
      // 5. End call
      await endCall(call.sid);
    },
    frequency: '*/15 * * * *', // Every 15 minutes
    timeout: 60000,
    alertThreshold: 2

    if (primaryHealth.consecutiveFailures >= config.failoverThreshold) {
      // 2. Find healthy fallback
      for (const fallback of config.fallbackEndpoints) {
        const fallbackHealth = await this.checkHealth(fallback);
        if (fallbackHealth.status === 'healthy') {
          // 3. Update routing
          await this.updateRouting(config.service, fallback);
          
          // 4. Notify operations
          await this.notifyFailover(config.service, fallback);
          
          // 5. Schedule recovery check
          setTimeout(() => {
            this.checkRecovery(config);
          }, config.recoveryDelay);
          
          break;
        }
