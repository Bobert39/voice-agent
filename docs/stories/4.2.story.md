# Story 4.2: Staff Dashboard and Monitoring Interface

**Epic**: Epic 4 - Production Operations & Staff Integration
**Story Points**: 13
**Priority**: High - Operational Oversight
**Risk Level**: Medium - User Adoption & Interface Complexity
**Status**: Ready for Review
## Story

**As a** practice staff member,  
**I want** to monitor AI system activity and patient interactions,  
**so that** I can provide oversight, handle escalations, and ensure quality patient care.

## Business Context

Capitol Eye Care staff need real-time visibility into the AI voice agent's operations to maintain quality patient service and handle situations requiring human intervention. The dashboard serves as the primary interface between staff and the AI system, enabling seamless collaboration and ensuring no patient falls through the cracks. Staff members ranging from receptionists to practice managers will use this interface throughout their workday.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ Create web-based dashboard showing real-time system status, active calls, and recent patient interactions
2. ✅ Implement escalation notification system with priority levels and response time tracking
3. ✅ Design conversation replay capability for staff review and quality improvement
4. ✅ Create patient lookup functionality for staff to access interaction history and appointment status
5. ✅ Implement manual override capabilities for staff to modify or correct AI-scheduled appointments
6. ✅ Test dashboard usability with actual practice staff during pilot testing scenarios

```

### Core Dashboard Components

#### 1. Real-Time Monitoring Panel

**Active Calls Widget**
```typescript
interface ActiveCall {
  callId: string;
  patientName: string;
  patientMRN: string;
  callDuration: number;
  currentState: 'greeting' | 'verification' | 'inquiry' | 'scheduling' | 'closing';
  aiConfidence: number;
  escalationRisk: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  audioStreamUrl?: string;
}
```

**System Status Indicators**
- Voice AI Service: Online/Offline/Degraded
- OpenEMR Connection: Connected/Disconnected
- Average Response Time: <2s (green), 2-5s (yellow), >5s (red)
- Active Call Count: Current/Peak/Average
- Queue Length: Waiting calls
- Staff Available: Online staff members

#### 2. Escalation Management System

**Priority Levels**
```typescript
enum EscalationPriority {
  CRITICAL = 1,  // Patient distress, medical emergency
  HIGH = 2,      // Verification failures, appointment conflicts
  MEDIUM = 3,    // Complex scheduling requests, confusion
  LOW = 4        // General questions, feedback
}

interface Escalation {
  id: string;
  priority: EscalationPriority;
  type: 'verification_failure' | 'scheduling_conflict' | 'patient_confusion' | 'technical_issue' | 'emergency';
  patientInfo: {
    name: string;
    mrn: string;
    phone: string;
  };
  context: {
    callTranscript: string[];
    aiRecommendation: string;
    triggerReason: string;
  };
  timing: {
    createdAt: Date;
    assignedTo?: string;
    acknowledgedAt?: Date;
    resolvedAt?: Date;
  };
  sla: {
    targetResponseTime: number; // seconds
    targetResolutionTime: number; // seconds
  };
}
```

**Notification System**
- Desktop browser notifications for new escalations
- Audio alerts with priority-based sounds
- Visual indicators (flashing, color coding)
- Mobile app push notifications (future)

#### 3. Conversation Replay Interface

**Audio Player Features**
- Synchronized transcript display
- Playback speed control (0.5x - 2x)
- Jump to specific conversation points
- Speaker identification (AI vs Patient)
- Sentiment indicators throughout call

**Transcript Viewer**
```typescript
interface TranscriptEntry {
  timestamp: Date;
  speaker: 'AI' | 'PATIENT';
  text: string;
  confidence: number;
  sentiment: 'positive' | 'neutral' | 'negative';
  intent?: string;
  entities?: Record<string, string>;
}
```

**Quality Review Tools**
- Flag conversation segments for training
- Add staff notes and corrections
- Rate AI performance (1-5 scale)
- Export conversations for compliance

#### 4. Patient Interaction History

**Search and Filter Capabilities**
```typescript
interface PatientSearchParams {
  query?: string;          // Name, MRN, phone
  dateRange?: DateRange;
  interactionType?: 'call' | 'appointment' | 'inquiry';
  status?: 'completed' | 'escalated' | 'failed';
  staffMember?: string;
}
```

**Interaction Timeline View**
- Chronological list of all interactions
- Expandable details for each interaction
- Related appointments and outcomes
- Staff actions and overrides
- System events and errors

#### 5. Manual Override Interface

**Appointment Management**
```typescript
interface AppointmentOverride {
  originalAppointment: {
    id: string;
    dateTime: Date;
    provider: string;
    type: string;
    aiScheduled: boolean;
  };
  override: {
    action: 'modify' | 'cancel' | 'confirm';
    newDateTime?: Date;
    newProvider?: string;
    reason: string;
    staffId: string;
  };
  validation: {
    conflicts: ConflictCheck[];
    warnings: string[];
    requiresApproval: boolean;
  };
}
```

**Override Safeguards**
- Conflict detection before saving
- Audit trail for all manual changes
- Patient notification requirements
- Supervisor approval for certain changes

#### Responsive Design
- Desktop: Full dashboard with all panels
- Tablet: Collapsible sidebar, touch-optimized
- Mobile: Escalation-focused view for on-call staff

### Role-Based Access Control

```typescript
enum StaffRole {
  RECEPTIONIST = 'receptionist',
  MEDICAL_ASSISTANT = 'medical_assistant',
  SUPERVISOR = 'supervisor',
  ADMIN = 'admin'
}

interface RolePermissions {
  viewActiveCalls: boolean;
  listenToLiveCalls: boolean;
  takeOverCalls: boolean;
  viewTranscripts: boolean;
  modifyAppointments: boolean;
  viewAuditLogs: boolean;
  configureSystem: boolean;
  viewAnalytics: boolean;
}

const rolePermissions: Record<StaffRole, RolePermissions> = {
  [StaffRole.RECEPTIONIST]: {
    viewActiveCalls: true,
    listenToLiveCalls: false,
    takeOverCalls: true,
    viewTranscripts: true,
    modifyAppointments: true,
    viewAuditLogs: false,
    configureSystem: false,
    viewAnalytics: false
  },
  [StaffRole.SUPERVISOR]: {
    viewActiveCalls: true,
    listenToLiveCalls: true,
    takeOverCalls: true,
    viewTranscripts: true,
    modifyAppointments: true,
    viewAuditLogs: true,
    configureSystem: true,
    viewAnalytics: true
  }
  // ... other roles
};
```

### Real-Time Communication
