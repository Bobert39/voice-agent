# Story 4.4: Staff Training and Documentation System

**Epic**: Epic 4 - Production Operations & Staff Integration
**Story Points**: 8
**Priority**: High - User Adoption Critical
**Risk Level**: Medium - Change Management Impact
**Status**: Ready for Development

## Story

**As a** practice staff member,  
**I want** comprehensive training and reference materials for working with the AI system,  
**so that** I can effectively collaborate with the AI and provide excellent patient service.

## Business Context

Capitol Eye Care's success with the AI voice agent depends entirely on staff confidence and competence in using the system. Well-trained staff can leverage the AI to enhance patient care, while poorly trained staff may resist the technology or use it ineffectively. This comprehensive training system ensures every staff member—from receptionists to practice managers—understands how to collaborate with the AI for optimal patient outcomes.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ Create comprehensive staff training materials covering AI system capabilities, limitations, and escalation procedures
2. ✅ Design interactive training modules that simulate common patient scenarios and staff responses
3. ✅ Implement quick reference guides for troubleshooting common issues and handling escalations
4. ✅ Create documentation for configuration changes, system updates, and maintenance procedures
5. ✅ Design feedback collection system for staff to report issues and suggest improvements
6. ✅ Test training effectiveness with staff competency assessments and ongoing education requirements
