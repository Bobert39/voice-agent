## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Story 1.2 (HIPAA-Compliant Cloud Infrastructure) is currently in Draft status. This story (1.3) focuses on OpenEMR connectivity validation which can be developed independently while infrastructure setup continues.

### Technical Architecture References

#### OpenEMR API Configuration [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#openemr-api]
- **Base URLs**:
  - Standard API: `https://your-openemr-instance.com/apis/default/api`
  - FHIR R4 API: `https://your-openemr-instance.com/apis/default/fhir`
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant with SSL/TLS mandatory
- **Rate Limits**: No specific limits documented, implement client-side throttling at 10 requests/second
- **Token Management**: Access tokens valid for 1 hour, refresh tokens for 3 months

#### Key Endpoints to Implement [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#openemr-api]
- `GET /api/patient` - Retrieve patient demographics for verification
- `POST /api/patient/{pid}/appointment` - Create new appointments
- `GET /api/patient/{pid}/appointment` - Query existing appointments
- `PUT /api/patient/{pid}/appointment/{eid}` - Modify appointment details
- `DELETE /api/patient/{pid}/appointment/{eid}` - Cancel appointments
- `GET /fhir/Appointment` - FHIR-compliant appointment queries
- `POST /oauth2/{site}/token` - OAuth token management

#### Technology Stack [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **HTTP Client**: Axios 1.6.2 - For OpenEMR API calls with retry logic
- **OAuth Library**: node-oauth2-server 4.3.0 - OAuth Authorization Code Grant implementation

#### Existing OpenEMR Client Location [Source: Project Structure]
- **File Path**: `packages/scheduling-service/src/services/openemr-client.ts`

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-12

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The OpenEMR integration implementation demonstrates solid architectural patterns and comprehensive feature coverage, but has critical test reliability issues that need immediate attention. The core OAuth 2.0 implementation with PKCE, circuit breaker pattern, and rate limiting shows strong engineering practices. However, 8 out of 25 tests are currently failing, primarily due to mock configuration issues and URL encoding problems.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring performed due to test failures requiring resolution first. The following issues must be addressed:

- **Test Mocks**: PKCE challenge generation tests have incorrect length expectations
- **URL Encoding**: Authorization URL scope encoding issues (+ vs %20)
- **Async Handling**: Circuit breaker and retry logic tests have timing/promise issues
- **Error Response Mocking**: Fetch mock responses not properly structured

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✗ Test failures indicate quality issues
- Project Structure: ✓ Files properly organized in packages/scheduling-service
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Only 70.4% coverage (requirement: 85%)
- All ACs Met: ✗ Implementation exists but quality gates failing

### Improvements Checklist

[Critical issues that must be resolved before approval]

- [ ] Fix PKCE challenge generation test expectations (expect 43-char base64, not 128)
- [ ] Correct URL encoding in authorization URL (scope parameter handling)
- [ ] Fix circuit breaker test timing issues (async/await patterns)
- [ ] Improve fetch mock responses for error scenarios
- [ ] Increase test coverage from 70.4% to minimum 85%
- [ ] Add integration tests for complete OAuth flow
- [ ] Fix retry logic test async handling
- [ ] Add missing error scenario coverage

### Security Review

✓ **OAuth 2.0 Implementation**: Proper PKCE implementation with S256 challenge method
✓ **Token Storage**: AWS Secrets Manager integration planned (not yet implemented)
✓ **SSL/TLS**: Certificate validation enabled
⚠️ **Rate Limiting**: Implementation present but test failures indicate potential issues

### Performance Considerations

✓ **Circuit Breaker**: 5-failure threshold with 60s reset period implemented
✓ **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with max 3 retries
✓ **Rate Limiting**: 10 requests/second throttling
⚠️ **Connection Pooling**: Not explicitly implemented for HTTP client

### Files Modified During Review

No files modified - test failures must be resolved first.

### Gate Status

Gate: FAIL → docs/qa/gates/1.3-openemr-connectivity-validation.yml
Risk profile: [To be generated after test fixes]
NFR assessment: [To be generated after test fixes]

### Recommended Status

✗ **Changes Required** - Critical test failures must be resolved before approval

**Summary**: While the implementation shows excellent architectural patterns and comprehensive feature coverage, the failing tests indicate reliability concerns that violate our quality standards. The code demonstrates strong engineering practices but needs immediate attention to test infrastructure and coverage requirements.
