## Dev Notes

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: Epic 1 requirements and architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Telephony**: Twilio Voice API with SIP integration
- **Speech-to-Text**: OpenAI Whisper API (supports multiple languages, medical terminology)
- **Text-to-Speech**: ElevenLabs API with elderly-optimized voice profiles
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20.11.0 LTS with TypeScript 5.3.3
- **Framework**: Express.js 4.18.2 for webhook endpoints
- **Testing**: Jest 29.7.0 with Twilio webhook testing utilities

### Voice AI Service Architecture
[Source: packages/voice-ai-service structure analysis]
- Service already exists with conversation management and escalation handling
- Current structure includes contextManager, conversationFlowHandler, and conversationManager
- Integration points: packages/voice-ai-service/src/services/
- Webhook endpoints: packages/voice-ai-service/src/routes/
- Audio processing: New service needed in packages/voice-ai-service/src/services/audio/

### External API Configuration
[Source: Architecture requirements and API documentation]
- **Twilio**: Voice API, TwiML webhooks, audio streaming capabilities
- **OpenAI**: Whisper model for transcription, streaming audio support
- **ElevenLabs**: Streaming TTS API, voice customization, real-time audio generation
- All APIs require secure credential management via AWS Secrets Manager

### Conversation Flow Requirements
[Source: Epic 1 AC and elderly user requirements]
- Primary use case: Practice hours inquiry ("Are you open?")
- Response pattern: Clear, slow-paced speech suitable for elderly patients
- Timeout handling: 30-second maximum conversation duration
- Escalation triggers: Unable to understand after 3 attempts
- Success metrics: >90% call completion rate, <5 second response time

### HIPAA Compliance Considerations
[Source: architecture/security.md and coding standards]
- No PHI collected in basic hours inquiry flow
- All audio processing must be logged without storing actual audio content
- Audit trails required for all external API calls
- Error handling must not expose internal system details
- Call metadata logging for operational monitoring only

### Integration with Existing Services
[Source: Story 1.1 completion and current package structure]
- Use shared-utils logger for HIPAA-compliant audit logging
- Integrate with practice-info-service for current hours calculation
- Connect to escalation services for staff notification when needed
- Use existing health check patterns from other microservices

### Development Environment Setup
[Source: Story 1.1 configuration and Twilio best practices]
- Local development requires ngrok for webhook testing
- Twilio test credentials for development and CI/CD environments
- Audio file samples for testing transcription accuracy
- Mock services for external API integration testing

### Performance Requirements
[Source: Elderly user experience requirements]
- Audio latency: <2 seconds from speech end to response start
- Transcription accuracy: >95% for clear speech, >85% with background noise
- TTS quality: Natural voice with appropriate pacing for elderly users
- Call handling capacity: Support for concurrent calls (10+ simultaneous)

### Error Scenarios and Fallbacks
[Source: Architecture error handling strategy]
- OpenAI API failure → Fallback to basic keyword recognition
- ElevenLabs API failure → Fallback to system TTS or pre-recorded messages
- Network issues → Graceful degradation with timeout handling
- Transcription failures → Request caller to repeat or transfer to staff
- System overload → Queue management with expected wait time announcements

### Testing Strategy
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- Unit tests: 85% coverage for all voice processing logic
- Integration tests: Full webhook flow testing with Twilio test framework
- Audio testing: Sample recordings for transcription accuracy validation
- Load testing: Concurrent call handling and system performance validation
- User acceptance testing: Real phone calls with practice staff feedback

### Security Implementation
[Source: architecture/security.md]
- Webhook signature verification for Twilio requests
- API key rotation and secure credential storage
- Rate limiting for webhook endpoints to prevent abuse
- Input validation for all voice input processing
- Comprehensive logging without PHI exposure

### File Organization
Based on existing voice-ai-service structure:
- Audio services: `/packages/voice-ai-service/src/services/audio/`
- Webhook routes: `/packages/voice-ai-service/src/routes/voice/`
- TTS integration: `/packages/voice-ai-service/src/services/tts/`
- STT integration: `/packages/voice-ai-service/src/services/stt/`
- Configuration: Environment variables in service .env.example

### Cost Considerations
[Source: Budget requirements and API pricing]
- Twilio Voice API: ~$0.013/minute for inbound calls
- OpenAI Whisper: ~$0.006/minute for transcription
- ElevenLabs TTS: ~$0.018/1K characters generated
- Target: <$50/month for basic hours inquiry volume
- Monitoring: AWS Budgets integration for cost tracking

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-16

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Review Status: BLOCKED - Implementation Required

**Prerequisites Not Met:**
- Story status is "Ready for Implementation" but no development work has begun
- All tasks remain unchecked - no code has been created
- No files have been implemented in voice-ai-service package
- Cannot perform code quality assessment on unimplemented story

### Code Quality Assessment

**Cannot assess** - No implementation exists to review. Story 1.4 requires complete voice AI integration development before QA review can proceed.

### Refactoring Performed

None - No code exists to refactor.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: N/A - No code to review
- Project Structure: N/A - No voice AI integration created
- Testing Strategy: N/A - No tests to evaluate
- All ACs Met: ❌ - No acceptance criteria implemented

### Requirements Analysis

**Acceptance Criteria Status:**
1. ❌ Twilio telephony integration - Not started
2. ❌ OpenAI Whisper speech-to-text - Not started
3. ❌ ElevenLabs text-to-speech configuration - Not started
4. ❌ Basic conversation flow for practice hours - Not started
5. ❌ End-to-end voice interaction testing - Not started
6. ❌ Error handling and graceful degradation - Not started

### Critical Dependencies

**Story 1.4 depends on:**
- ✅ Story 1.1 (Project Setup) - COMPLETED with voice-ai-service package ready
- ❌ Story 1.2 (Infrastructure) - Required for API credential storage and security
- Twilio account setup and phone number configuration
- OpenAI API access and credentials
- ElevenLabs API access and voice profile configuration

### Architecture Review

**Excellent technical planning** detected in Dev Notes:
- Comprehensive integration strategy with external APIs (Twilio, OpenAI, ElevenLabs)
- Thoughtful elderly-friendly voice design requirements
- Appropriate error handling and fallback strategies
- HIPAA-compliant approach without PHI collection
- Realistic performance targets (<2s latency, >95% transcription accuracy)

### Security Review

**Cannot assess security implementation** until code exists. However, planned approach shows strong security awareness:
- Webhook signature verification for Twilio
- Secure credential management via AWS Secrets Manager
- Rate limiting for abuse prevention
- Audit logging without PHI exposure
- Input validation for voice processing

### Performance Considerations

**Cannot assess performance** until implementation exists. Planned metrics appear realistic:
- <2 second audio latency target
- >95% transcription accuracy for clear speech
- Support for 10+ concurrent calls
- <$50/month cost target for basic volume

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH RISK** - Voice AI integration is core Epic 1 functionality. Current risk factors:
- No voice processing capabilities implemented
- External API integrations not configured
- No telephony system connectivity
- Patient interaction flow unavailable
- Testing framework for voice AI missing

### Dependencies Blocking Progress

1. **Story 1.2 Infrastructure** - AWS Secrets Manager needed for API credentials
2. **External Service Accounts** - Twilio, OpenAI, ElevenLabs accounts required
3. **Phone System Integration** - SIP configuration with Capitol Eye Care needed

### Gate Status

Gate: FAIL → docs/qa/gates/1.4-basic-voice-ai-telephony-integration.yml
Risk profile: High risk - Core functionality missing
Reason: Implementation required before QA review possible

### Recommended Status

[❌ Implementation Required]
Story should be moved to "In Progress" and development work completed. Priority should be given to Story 1.2 infrastructure first for credential management, then proceed with voice AI integration implementation.
