- **OpenAI**: Whisper model for transcription, streaming audio support
- **ElevenLabs**: Streaming TTS API, voice customization, real-time audio generation
- All APIs require secure credential management via AWS Secrets Manager

### Conversation Flow Requirements
[Source: Epic 1 AC and elderly user requirements]
- Primary use case: Practice hours inquiry ("Are you open?")
- Response pattern: Clear, slow-paced speech suitable for elderly patients
- Timeout handling: 30-second maximum conversation duration
- Escalation triggers: Unable to understand after 3 attempts
- Success metrics: >90% call completion rate, <5 second response time

### HIPAA Compliance Considerations
[Source: architecture/security.md and coding standards]
- No PHI collected in basic hours inquiry flow
- All audio processing must be logged without storing actual audio content
- Audit trails required for all external API calls
- Error handling must not expose internal system details
- Call metadata logging for operational monitoring only

### Integration with Existing Services
[Source: Story 1.1 completion and current package structure]
- Use shared-utils logger for HIPAA-compliant audit logging
- Integrate with practice-info-service for current hours calculation
- Connect to escalation services for staff notification when needed
- Use existing health check patterns from other microservices

### Development Environment Setup
[Source: Story 1.1 configuration and Twilio best practices]
- Local development requires ngrok for webhook testing
- Twilio test credentials for development and CI/CD environments

### Performance Requirements
[Source: Elderly user experience requirements]
- Audio latency: <2 seconds from speech end to response start
- Transcription accuracy: >95% for clear speech, >85% with background noise
- TTS quality: Natural voice with appropriate pacing for elderly users
- Call handling capacity: Support for concurrent calls (10+ simultaneous)

### Error Scenarios and Fallbacks
[Source: Architecture error handling strategy]
- OpenAI API failure → Fallback to basic keyword recognition
- ElevenLabs API failure → Fallback to system TTS or pre-recorded messages
- Network issues → Graceful degradation with timeout handling
- Transcription failures → Request caller to repeat or transfer to staff
- System overload → Queue management with expected wait time announcements

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests: 85% coverage for all voice processing logic
- Integration tests: Full webhook flow testing with Twilio test framework
- Audio testing: Sample recordings for transcription accuracy validation
- Load testing: Concurrent call handling and system performance validation
- User acceptance testing: Real phone calls with practice staff feedback

### Security Implementation
[Source: architecture/security.md]
- Webhook signature verification for Twilio requests
- API key rotation and secure credential storage
- Rate limiting for webhook endpoints to prevent abuse
- Input validation for all voice input processing
- Comprehensive logging without PHI exposure

### File Organization
