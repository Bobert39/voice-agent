- **Notification Failures**: Multiple channel retry with escalation to backup staff
- **Context Transfer Errors**: Graceful degradation with conversation summary
- **Queue System Failures**: Fallback to direct staff notification
- **Authentication Failures**: Secure guest access for emergency escalations

### Emergency Escalation Protocols
