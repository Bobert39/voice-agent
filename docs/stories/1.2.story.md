## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 1.1 Dev Agent Record]
- Monorepo structure is complete with all 5 microservices ready
- Each service already has health endpoints and error handlers
- Winston logging is configured in all services for HIPAA compliance
- Services are ready for cloud deployment configuration

### AWS Services Configuration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#cloud-infrastructure]
- **Provider**: AWS (Amazon Web Services)
- **Key Services**: Lambda, API Gateway, RDS PostgreSQL, ElastiCache Redis, SQS, SNS, CloudWatch, S3, Secrets Manager, VPC
- **Deployment Regions**: us-west-2 (primary), us-east-1 (failover)
- **Lambda Runtime**: nodejs20.x for all microservices

### Database Configuration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- **PostgreSQL**: Version 15.4 for primary data storage
- **Redis**: Version 7.2 for session/token storage
- Must ensure ACID compliance for appointment data
- Fast OAuth token caching requirements

### Security and Compliance Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#hipaa-compliance-additions]
- **AWS CloudTrail**: For immutable audit logs (HIPAA 2025 requirements)
- **AWS Config**: Track security configuration changes
- **AWS Inspector**: Bi-annual vulnerability scans
- **AWS KMS**: Centralized key rotation for PHI
- **AWS WAF**: Web application firewall for OWASP Top 10 protection
- **AWS IAM**: Role-based access with principle of least privilege

### Infrastructure as Code
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- **AWS CDK**: Version 2.114.0 (TypeScript-native)
- Preferred over CloudFormation for better TypeScript integration
- Aligns with monorepo TypeScript configuration from Story 1.1

### Monitoring and Backup Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Native monitoring with custom metrics and alarms
- **AWS X-Ray**: Distributed tracing for microservice debugging
- **AWS Backup**: Automated backups meeting HIPAA retention requirements
- **AWS Budgets**: Cost monitoring to stay within $2-3K monthly budget

### Encryption Requirements
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
- Field-level encryption for all PII using AES-256
- Comprehensive audit trails required
- HIPAA-compliant retention policies

### Infrastructure Strategy
[Source: architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md]
- Use AWS CDK for Infrastructure as Code
- HIPAA-compliant configurations required
- Blue-green serverless deployment strategy
- Automated testing and security scanning
- Gradual traffic shifting with rapid rollback capabilities

### Security Implementation Notes
[Source: architecture/security.md]
- Field-level PII encryption required
- OAuth 2.0 authentication infrastructure
- Comprehensive input validation
- HIPAA-compliant audit trails
- Defense in depth with multiple security layers

### File Locations
Based on monorepo structure from Story 1.1:
- Infrastructure code should be created in `/infrastructure/` directory
- CDK stacks in `/infrastructure/cdk/`
- Configuration files in `/infrastructure/config/`
- Documentation in `/docs/infrastructure/`

### Cost Considerations
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Target budget: $2-3K monthly
- Use AWS Budgets for alerts
- Optimize for variable call volume with serverless

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- 85% unit test coverage requirement
- Use Jest 29.7.0 for testing (already configured in Story 1.1)
- Test infrastructure code with CDK testing utilities
- Validate all HIPAA compliance configurations
- Test disaster recovery procedures
