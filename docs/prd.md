# AI Voice Agent for Capitol Eye Care Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
• **Capture 1-2 additional patient appointments daily within 30 days** - generating $50,000-100,000 additional annual revenue through 24/7 availability
• **Reduce staff time spent on routine communication by 15-25%** (approximately 1.5 hours daily) enabling focus on direct patient care
• **Establish Capitol Eye Care as Salem's first AI-enabled optometry practice** creating competitive differentiation and market leadership
• **Build foundational MVP for scalable business model** - creating sustainable income stream and transferable AI expertise for family financial security
• **Maintain 90%+ patient satisfaction** while automating routine scheduling and inquiry handling
• **Achieve 99%+ system uptime** with seamless OpenEMR integration for real-time appointment management

### Background Context

Capitol Eye Care faces a critical revenue constraint losing 2-4 potential patients daily ($400-800 in lost revenue) because appointment scheduling is only available during business hours. This single limitation costs approximately $100,000+ annually in missed opportunities. Additionally, clinical staff dedicates 22% of operational time (2+ hours daily) to indirect patient communication, diverting resources from direct patient care.

The AI Voice Agent solution addresses these core business problems by providing 24/7 appointment scheduling and basic inquiry handling through direct OpenEMR integration. Unlike generic answering services, this system offers real-time scheduling capabilities, elderly-friendly voice interactions, and HIPAA-compliant architecture designed specifically for small medical practices. The project targets Salem's 6-month first-mover advantage window while building toward a scalable platform solution for long-term family financial security.
