# Sprint Change Proposal
**Date:** December 18, 2024
**Author:** John (Product Manager)
**Status:** Draft for Review

## Executive Summary

This proposal addresses two critical issues discovered in the voice agent project:
1. **TypeScript build system failures** preventing deployment (blocking)
2. **Removal of elderly-specific requirements** to simplify scope (strategic)

Both changes are necessary for successful project delivery and will require coordinated effort across multiple components.

---

## Section 1: Change Context & Triggers

### Issue 1: TypeScript Build System Failures ❌

**Trigger:** Build command (`npm run build`) fails with 50+ TypeScript compilation errors

**Core Problem:**
- Cross-package imports violating TypeScript rootDir constraints
- Missing npm dependencies in audit-service
- Type safety violations and unused variables
- Services cannot be compiled or deployed

**Evidence:**
- TS6059: Files not under correct rootDir
- TS6307: Files not listed in project tsconfig
- Missing: joi@^17.12.0, aws-sdk@^2.1531.0, fluent-logger@^3.4.1
- Multiple TS2322, TS6133, TS2339 errors

**Impact:** **CRITICAL** - Blocks all deployment and testing activities

### Issue 2: Elderly-Specific Requirements Removal 📋

**Trigger:** User request to remove elderly-specific features throughout project

**Core Problem:**
- 47 files contain elderly-specific functionality
- 200+ references to elderly/senior requirements
- Dedicated services and test suites for elderly features
- Adds unnecessary complexity to MVP

**Evidence:**
- Complete elderly-optimization-service.ts (357 lines)
- elderly-specific-accessibility-testing-framework.md (1000+ lines)
- Elderly mode integrated into core NLU, TTS, and conversation flows
- Environment variable ELDERLY_MODE_ENABLED

**Impact:** **MODERATE** - Reduces scope complexity and maintenance burden

## Section 8: Comprehensive Testing Requirements

### Testing Strategy Overview

The testing phase is critical to ensure both the build system fixes and elderly requirement removal don't introduce regressions. We will implement a multi-layered testing approach with clear pass/fail criteria.

### Test Coverage Requirements

#### Minimum Coverage Targets
- **Overall Code Coverage:** ≥80% (current baseline)
- **New/Modified Code:** ≥90% coverage required
- **Critical Path Coverage:** 100% for authentication, scheduling, voice processing
- **Integration Test Coverage:** ≥70% for cross-service communication

#### Coverage Breakdown by Service

| Service | Current Coverage | Target Coverage | Critical Paths |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| voice-ai-service | 75% | 85% | Voice processing, NLU, TTS |
| scheduling-service | 72% | 85% | Appointment CRUD, availability |
| patient-verification | 88% | 90% | Auth flow, session management |
| practice-info-service | 83% | 85% | Hours, services, providers |
| audit-service | 45% | 80% | Logging, PHI masking, storage |
| shared-utils | 91% | 95% | All utility functions |

### Testing Phases

#### Phase 1: Build Verification Testing (After Build Fixes)

**1.1 Compilation Testing**
```bash
# Clean build test
npm run clean && npm run build
# Expected: 0 TypeScript errors

# Individual package compilation
for pkg in voice-ai scheduling patient-verification practice-info audit; do
  cd packages/$pkg-service
  npx tsc --noEmit
  # Expected: 0 errors per package
done
```

**1.2 Dependency Testing**
- Verify all packages have required dependencies
- Test cross-package imports work correctly
- Validate TypeScript project references
- Check for circular dependencies

**1.3 Unit Test Restoration**
```bash
# Run all unit tests
npm test
# Expected: All existing tests pass
# Acceptable failure rate: 0%
```

#### Phase 2: Elderly Removal Testing (After Feature Removal)

**2.1 Feature Removal Verification**
```bash
# Search verification - should return 0 results
grep -r "elderly\|senior\|geriatric" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" packages/
# Expected: 0 matches in source code

# Environment variable check
grep -r "ELDERLY_MODE" .env* packages/
# Expected: 0 matches
```

**2.2 Regression Testing Suite**

**Core Conversation Flows (Must Pass 100%)**
- [ ] Basic greeting and intent recognition
- [ ] Patient verification without elderly optimizations
- [ ] Appointment booking standard flow
- [ ] Appointment modification flow
- [ ] Appointment cancellation flow
- [ ] Practice information queries
- [ ] Human escalation triggers

**Voice Processing Tests**
```typescript
// Test standard voice settings
describe('Voice Configuration After Elderly Removal', () => {
  test('uses standard speech rate', () => {
    expect(voiceConfig.speed).toBe(1.0);
  });

  test('uses standard stability settings', () => {
    expect(voiceConfig.stability).toBe(0.5);
  });

  test('no age-based branching in conversation flow', () => {
    // Verify no conditional logic based on age
  });
});
```

**2.3 NLU Accuracy Testing**
- Minimum 85% intent recognition accuracy
- Entity extraction accuracy ≥90%
- Multi-turn context retention ≥95%
- Response time <500ms for 95th percentile

#### Phase 3: Integration Testing

**3.1 Cross-Service Communication**
```typescript
// Integration test example
describe('Service Integration After Changes', () => {
  test('voice-ai can call scheduling-service', async () => {
    const result = await voiceService.bookAppointment(testData);
    expect(result.status).toBe('success');
  });

  test('scheduling can access patient-verification', async () => {
    const verified = await schedulingService.verifyPatient(patientId);
    expect(verified).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```

**3.2 End-to-End Test Scenarios**

| Scenario | Test Steps | Expected Result | Priority |
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|
| Complete appointment booking | Greeting → Verification → Booking → Confirmation | Appointment created | P0 |
| Appointment modification | Verification → Find appointment → Modify → Confirm | Appointment updated | P0 |
| Practice info query | Greeting → Hours request → Response | Correct info provided | P1 |
| Failed verification | Wrong DOB → Retry → Escalation | Human handoff triggered | P0 |
| Complex multi-turn | 5+ conversation turns with context | Context maintained | P1 |

**3.3 Database Integration Tests**
- Verify all CRUD operations work
- Test transaction rollbacks
- Validate data consistency
- Check audit log creation

| Voice Processing Latency | 850ms | <1000ms | End-to-end voice test |
| Memory Usage per Service | 110MB | <150MB | Monitor during load test |
| CPU Usage (average) | 25% | <30% | Monitor during load test |
| Concurrent Sessions | 45 | ≥50 | Stress test to failure |

**4.2 Load Testing Script**
```javascript
// K6 load test example
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check } from 'k6';

export let options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '2m', target: 50 },  // Ramp up
    { duration: '5m', target: 50 },  // Sustain
    { duration: '2m', target: 100 }, // Stress
    { duration: '2m', target: 0 },   // Ramp down
  ],
  thresholds: {
    http_req_duration: ['p(95)<500'],
    http_req_failed: ['rate<0.01'],
  },
};

export default function() {
  let response = http.post('http://localhost:3000/voice/call', {
    // Test payload
  });

  check(response, {
    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
    'response time < 500ms': (r) => r.timings.duration < 500,
