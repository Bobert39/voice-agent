# Quality Gate Decision - Story 1.3
schema: 1
story: "1.3"
story_title: "OpenEMR Connectivity Validation"
gate: FAIL
status_reason: "Critical test failures (8/25 failing) and insufficient coverage (70.4% vs 85% requirement) indicate quality reliability concerns that must be resolved."

    notes: "OAuth 2.0 with PKCE properly implemented but test failures reduce confidence in security controls"
  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Circuit breaker and rate limiting implemented but tests failing indicate potential runtime issues"
  reliability:
    status: FAIL
    notes: "Test failures indicate reliability concerns - async operations and error handling need validation"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Code structure and documentation quality excellent, follows architectural patterns"
