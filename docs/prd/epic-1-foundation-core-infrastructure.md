# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure

Establish secure, HIPAA-compliant technical foundation with microservices architecture, implement basic voice AI telephony capability, and validate OpenEMR connectivity. This epic creates the essential infrastructure while delivering a minimal but functional voice response system that can answer calls and provide a basic health-check interaction, proving the technical approach before significant feature development investment.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup and Repository Structure
**As a** developer,  
**I want** to create the monorepo structure with separate packages for each microservice,  
**so that** I can develop, test, and deploy services independently while maintaining code organization.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Create monorepo with packages for voice-ai-service, scheduling-service, patient-verification-service, audit-service, and admin-dashboard
2. Configure TypeScript with shared configurations and build scripts for all packages
3. Set up package.json with workspace configuration and shared dependencies
4. Implement basic Express.js setup for each service with health-check endpoints
5. Configure development environment with concurrent service startup scripts
6. Create basic README with development setup instructions and service architecture overview

## Story 1.2: HIPAA-Compliant Cloud Infrastructure Setup
**As a** practice owner,  
**I want** the system to operate on HIPAA-compliant cloud infrastructure,  
**so that** patient data is protected according to healthcare regulations from day one.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Configure AWS HIPAA-eligible services including VPC, encrypted databases, and secure networking
2. Implement end-to-end encryption for data transmission between all services
3. Set up PostgreSQL with encryption at rest and secure connection strings
4. Configure Redis for session management with appropriate security settings
5. Establish automated backup systems for all data storage components
6. Document HIPAA compliance measures and security configuration for audit purposes

## Story 1.3: OpenEMR Connectivity Validation
**As a** system integrator,  
**I want** to establish and test real-time connectivity with OpenEMR's REST API,  
**so that** appointment scheduling functionality is technically feasible before building complex features.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Research and document OpenEMR REST API endpoints, authentication requirements, and rate limits
2. Implement secure OAuth 2.0 authentication with OpenEMR system
3. Successfully retrieve appointment calendar data from OpenEMR in test environment
4. Test appointment creation, modification, and deletion operations via API
5. Validate conflict detection and prevention mechanisms for scheduling overlaps
6. Document API capabilities, limitations, and integration patterns for scheduling service

## Story 1.4: Basic Voice AI Telephony Integration
**As a** patient,  
**I want** to call the practice and receive an AI voice response,  
**so that** I can confirm the system is operational and ready for basic interactions.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Integrate Twilio telephony service with practice phone system via SIP configuration
2. Implement basic speech-to-text using OpenAI Whisper for simple voice input recognition
3. Configure text-to-speech using ElevenLabs with elderly-friendly voice profile
4. Create simple conversation flow that can answer "Are you open?" with current practice hours
5. Test end-to-end voice interaction from phone call to AI response and call termination
6. Implement basic error handling for voice AI service failures with graceful degradation

## Story 1.5: Service Communication and Health Monitoring
**As a** system administrator,  
**I want** all services to communicate securely and report their health status,  
**so that** I can monitor system reliability and troubleshoot integration issues.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement secure inter-service communication using API authentication and encryption
2. Create health-check endpoints for all services reporting database connectivity and external API status
3. Configure service discovery mechanism for microservices to locate and communicate with each other
4. Implement centralized logging system for all services with structured log formats
5. Set up basic monitoring dashboard showing service health and response times
6. Test service restart and recovery procedures with automatic health reporting
