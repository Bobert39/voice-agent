## Top Issues by Priority

**BLOCKERS**: None - PRD is ready for architect handoff

**HIGH**: 
- Voice interface design patterns need elaboration for elderly demographic optimization
- OpenEMR API technical validation should be completed early in Epic 1

**MEDIUM**: 
- Staff training curriculum details could be expanded
- Performance monitoring alerting thresholds could be more specific

**LOW**: 
- Consider adding user personas section reference to project brief
- Expand disaster recovery procedures in operational requirements

## MVP Scope Assessment

**Appropriate MVP Features**:
- 24/7 appointment scheduling (core revenue driver)
- Patient verification system (security foundation)
- Basic inquiry handling (immediate patient value)
- OpenEMR integration (technical differentiator)

**Scope Boundary Excellence**:
- Clear exclusions: multi-language, email/chat, prescription management
- Future roadmap: multi-practice platform, advanced analytics
- Timeline realistic: 3-6 months with single developer + consultation

**Technical Readiness**: Ready for architect handoff with comprehensive technical assumptions and clear implementation path.

**Final Decision**: **READY FOR ARCHITECT** - The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design.
