# Epic 2: Patient Identity & Basic Voice Interaction

Implement secure patient verification system and natural voice conversation capabilities for basic practice inquiries. This epic builds upon the foundation to deliver meaningful patient interactions while establishing the security patterns required for appointment scheduling. Patients can call and receive helpful information about practice hours, location, insurance, and preparation instructions, creating immediate value while validating voice AI effectiveness with the elderly demographic.

## Story 2.1: Patient Identity Verification Service
**As a** patient,  
**I want** to securely identify myself during phone calls,  
**so that** the system can access my information while protecting my privacy according to HIPAA requirements.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement patient verification using name, date of birth, and phone number lookup in OpenEMR
2. Create secure patient data retrieval with encrypted storage of verification sessions
3. Implement three-attempt verification limit with automatic escalation to staff for failures
4. Design conversation flow that naturally collects verification information without feeling invasive
5. Store successful verification sessions with timeout for subsequent calls within same session
6. Log all verification attempts for HIPAA audit trail with success/failure tracking

## Story 2.2: Natural Language Understanding for Basic Inquiries
**As a** patient,  
**I want** to ask questions naturally about the practice,  
**so that** I can get helpful information without navigating complex phone menus.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement GPT-4 integration with fine-tuned prompts for medical practice context and scheduling workflows
2. Create intent recognition for common inquiries: hours, location, insurance acceptance, preparation instructions
3. Design conversation flows that handle variations in how patients ask questions
4. Implement context awareness to maintain conversation thread across multiple questions
5. Create fallback responses for unrecognized inquiries with helpful alternatives
6. Test natural language understanding with elderly speech patterns and common medical terminology

## Story 2.3: Practice Information Response System
**As a** patient,  
**I want** to receive accurate information about practice hours, location, and policies,  
**so that** I can plan my visit and understand requirements without calling during business hours.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Create configurable practice information database including hours, location, insurance plans, preparation instructions
2. Implement dynamic responses based on current time (e.g., "We're currently open/closed")
3. Design elderly-friendly response patterns with slower pace and clear confirmation options
4. Create responses for common preparation questions (eye dilation, contact lens removal, insurance cards)
5. Implement holiday and closure schedule handling with advance notice capabilities
6. Test response clarity and comprehension with target demographic simulation

## Story 2.4: Multi-Turn Conversation Management
**As a** patient,  
**I want** to ask follow-up questions during the same call,  
**so that** I can get complete information without having to call back multiple times.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement conversation session management that maintains context across multiple exchanges
2. Create natural conversation flow that can handle topic changes and follow-up questions
3. Design graceful conversation ending with clear next steps or appointment scheduling options
4. Implement conversation timeout handling with polite transition to scheduling or escalation
5. Create conversation memory that can reference earlier parts of the same call
6. Test complex multi-turn conversations including topic switches and clarification requests

## Story 2.5: Human Escalation Integration
**As a** patient,  
**I want** to speak with a human when I have complex needs or prefer human interaction,  
**so that** I can receive personalized assistance for situations the AI cannot handle.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement intelligent escalation triggers for complex requests, emotional distress, or explicit human requests
2. Create seamless handoff mechanism that provides staff with conversation context and patient verification status
3. Design fallback escalation for AI service failures that maintains professional experience
4. Implement staff notification system for escalations with priority levels and response time expectations
5. Create escalation logging for pattern analysis and AI improvement opportunities
6. Test escalation scenarios including peak hours, after-hours, and emergency situation handling
