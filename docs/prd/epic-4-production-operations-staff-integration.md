3. Design log retention policies that meet HIPAA requirements while managing storage costs
4. Implement secure log storage with encryption and tamper-proof mechanisms
5. Create audit report generation capability for compliance reviews and regulatory inquiries
6. Test logging system with simulated audit scenarios and compliance validation procedures

## Story 4.2: Staff Dashboard and Monitoring Interface
**As a** practice staff member,  
**I want** to monitor AI system activity and patient interactions,  
**so that** I can provide oversight, handle escalations, and ensure quality patient care.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Create web-based dashboard showing real-time system status, active calls, and recent patient interactions
2. Implement escalation notification system with priority levels and response time tracking
3. Design conversation replay capability for staff review and quality improvement
4. Create patient lookup functionality for staff to access interaction history and appointment status
5. Implement manual override capabilities for staff to modify or correct AI-scheduled appointments
6. Test dashboard usability with actual practice staff during pilot testing scenarios

## Story 4.3: Performance Monitoring and Alerting
**As a** system administrator,  
**I want** proactive monitoring of system performance and availability,  
**so that** issues are detected and resolved before they impact patient experience.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement comprehensive system monitoring including response times, error rates, and service availability
2. Create automated alerting for system failures, performance degradation, and capacity thresholds
3. Design performance analytics dashboard showing key metrics and trends over time
4. Implement health checks for all external dependencies (OpenEMR, Twilio, voice AI services)
5. Create automated failover procedures for critical system components
6. Test monitoring and alerting systems with simulated failure scenarios and recovery procedures

## Story 4.4: Staff Training and Documentation System
**As a** practice staff member,  
**I want** comprehensive training and reference materials for working with the AI system,  
**so that** I can effectively collaborate with the AI and provide excellent patient service.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Create comprehensive staff training materials covering AI system capabilities, limitations, and escalation procedures
2. Design interactive training modules that simulate common patient scenarios and staff responses
3. Implement quick reference guides for troubleshooting common issues and handling escalations
4. Create documentation for configuration changes, system updates, and maintenance procedures
5. Design feedback collection system for staff to report issues and suggest improvements
6. Test training effectiveness with staff competency assessments and ongoing education requirements

## Story 4.5: System Configuration and Maintenance Tools
**As a** practice administrator,  
**I want** tools to configure system settings and manage ongoing maintenance,  
**so that** the AI system can be adapted to practice needs and kept current with policy changes.

### Acceptance Criteria
