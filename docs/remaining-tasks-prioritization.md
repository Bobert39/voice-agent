3. **Focus on user value** - prioritize tasks that directly improve patient experience
4. **Plan for iteration** - these enhancements can be delivered incrementally post-launch

### Decision Points
- **After Phase 1:** Evaluate production readiness before proceeding
- **After Phase 2:** Assess user feedback and reprioritize remaining tasks
- **Before Phase 3:** Consider if advanced features provide sufficient ROI
