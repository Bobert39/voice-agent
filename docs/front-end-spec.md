#### Flow Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Patient arrives] --> B[Voice greeting: "Welcome to Dr. Smith's office"]
    B --> C[Identity verification: "Please state your name and date of birth"]
    C --> D{Voice recognition successful?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Confirm identity: "I found John Doe, born January 1st, 1980. Is this correct?"]
    D -->|No| F[Fallback: "I didn't catch that. Please spell your last name"]
    F --> C
    E --> G{Patient confirms?}
    G -->|Yes| H[Symptom gathering: "What brings you in today?"]
    G -->|No| I[Clarification: "Let me help you find your record"]
    I --> C
    H --> J[Process symptoms with medical NLU]
    J --> K[Confirm understanding: "So you're experiencing blurry vision in your left eye?"]
    K --> L{Patient confirms symptoms?}
    L -->|Yes| M[Insurance verification: "Checking your insurance coverage..."]
    L -->|No| N[Clarification: "Help me understand your symptoms better"]
    N --> H
    M --> O[Complete check-in: "You're all set! Please have a seat."]
    O --> P[Update EHR and notify staff]
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- Background noise interference → "I'm having trouble hearing you. Could you move closer?"
- Ambiguous medical terms → "Did you mean [option A] or [option B]?"
- Patient with hearing impairment → Automatic fallback to visual interface
- System connectivity issues → "I'm having technical difficulties. Let me get a staff member."
- Insurance verification failure → "There may be an issue with your insurance. I'll flag this for our billing team."

**Notes:** Critical to maintain patient dignity during error recovery. All voice interactions should feel supportive, not frustrating.

### Flow 2: Practitioner Voice Documentation

**User Goal:** Document patient examination findings through voice while maintaining eye contact with patient

**Entry Points:**
- Voice activation during patient examination
- Post-examination documentation review
- Real-time note-taking during procedures

**Success Criteria:**
- Examination findings captured accurately in structured format
- Notes automatically formatted for EHR integration
- Practitioner maintains patient engagement throughout

#### Flow Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Practitioner begins exam] --> B["Voice command: 'Start exam documentation for [patient name]'"]
    B --> C[System confirms: "Recording exam notes for John Doe"]
    C --> D[Practitioner speaks findings naturally]
    D --> E[Real-time transcription with medical terminology processing]
    E --> F[System identifies structured data elements]
    F --> G[Periodic confirmation: "I've noted 20/40 vision OS. Continue."]
    G --> H{More findings to document?}
    H -->|Yes| D
    H -->|No| I["Voice command: 'Review and finalize notes'"]
    I --> J[System reads back structured summary]
    J --> K{Practitioner approves?}
    K -->|Yes| L[Auto-populate EHR fields]
    K -->|No| M[Edit mode: "What would you like to change?"]
    M --> N[Voice-guided corrections]
    N --> J
    L --> O[Confirmation: "Notes saved to patient record"]
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- Medical terminology misrecognition → Smart suggestions with confidence scoring
- Interruption by patient questions → Context preservation and resumption
- Practitioner speaks too quickly → "Please speak more slowly for accuracy"
- Technical jargon not in system vocabulary → Learning mode for new terms
- Conflicting data entry → "This differs from earlier notes. Should I update?"

**Notes:** Must feel invisible to patient experience while providing practitioner confidence in accuracy.
