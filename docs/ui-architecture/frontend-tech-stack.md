# Frontend Tech Stack

## Technology Stack Rationale

**Core Decisions:**
- **Next.js over React SPA**: Better performance for healthcare staff, built-in authentication patterns, server-side rendering for faster loads
- **Tailwind CSS**: Rapid development, consistent healthcare design system, excellent responsive support
- **NextAuth.js**: Seamless OpenEMR OAuth2 integration, healthcare-compliant session management
- **React Email**: Unified templating system across SMS/Email/Web interfaces
- **TypeScript**: Type safety for healthcare data, reduces medical software bugs

**Multi-Modal Integration:**
- **Shared component library** across all interface types
- **Unified state management** for consistent patient data
- **OpenEMR native integration** following 2024 OAuth2 patterns
- **Progressive Web App** capabilities for offline access

**Healthcare-Specific Considerations:**
- **HIPAA-compliant** state management and data handling
- **Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)** for diverse staff abilities
- **Professional medical UI patterns** following healthcare design standards
