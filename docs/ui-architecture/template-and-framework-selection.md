# Template and Framework Selection

Based on review of the PRD and existing backend architecture document, this project requires a **Multi-Modal Healthcare Interface System** supporting:

**Key Frontend Components:**
- **Staff Dashboard Web Application** (Primary UI)
- **Patient Web Portal Integration** (OpenEMR integration)
- **SMS/Email Interface System** (Notification templates)
- **Mobile Staff Companion App** (Future expansion)

**Framework Decision:** **Next.js + React + TypeScript** with multi-modal architecture

**OpenEMR Integration Research:**
- OAuth2 Authorization Code Grant with PKCE (2024 standard)
- JWT token management with automatic refresh
- Custom API integration following OpenEMR patterns
- Patient portal component integration

**Multi-Device Support:**
- **Desktop**: Full dashboard with multi-panel layout
- **Tablet**: Streamlined dashboard with touch-optimized UI
- **Phone**: Mobile-first staff app with push notifications

**Scalability Planning:**
- Component library for white-label customization
- Configuration-driven UI for multi-practice deployment
- Modular architecture supporting platform expansion
