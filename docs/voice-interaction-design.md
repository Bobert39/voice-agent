## 1. Elderly User Demographics & Constraints Analysis

### Primary User Profile: "Sarah" (78-year-old patient)
- **Technology Comfort**: Low to moderate, prefers voice over digital interfaces
- **Communication Style**: Appreciates slower pace, clear confirmations, familiar terminology
- **Common Challenges**: May need information repeated, prefers linear conversation flow

- **Multitasking Difficulty**: Avoid interruptions or parallel information streams

#### Physical Considerations
- **Hearing Changes**: Use slower speech rate (140-160 WPM vs. 180+ WPM standard)
- **Speech Clarity**: Account for dentures, medication effects, voice changes
- **Response Time**: Allow 3-5 seconds for response vs. 2 seconds standard
- **Fatigue Factors**: Keep total interaction under 3 minutes when possible

#### Technology Anxiety Factors
